# Young People
## Intro

The purpose of this project is to do a review of Pandas since I have been away
from it for so long. In this project, I am looking at survey data of young
people and what they like and do not like. The data may be found at the
following link: https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey.
I have to admit that not sure where this project will go as I start it...
