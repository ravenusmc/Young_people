# Young People
## Intro

The purpose of this project is to do a review of Pandas since I have been away
from it for so long. In this project, I am looking at survey data of young
people and what they like and do not like. The data may be found at the
following link: https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey. The
data is broken up in values for how much a person likes something. A 1
means that they don't enjoy it all whereas a 5 means they love it. 
I have to admit that not sure where this project will go as I start it...
